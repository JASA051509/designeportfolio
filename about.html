                                <ul>
                                    <li>Psychotherapy: Engaging with a therapist to explore emotions and develop coping strategies.</li>
                                    <li>Mindfulness Practices: Utilizing mindfulness to acknowledge and process painful emotions without judgment.</li>
                                    <li>Support Systems: Sharing experiences with trusted friends or support groups can foster understanding and healing.</li>

                            <p>Self-compassion involves treating oneself with kindness during times of suffering or failure.
